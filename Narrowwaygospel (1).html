  <h1 style=";color:black"><strong><center>THIS IS THE NARROW WAY<br>GOSPEL REVIVAL MESSAGE</center></strong></h1>
  <p style="color:powderblue"align="center">As it is written in the bible, it says the word would spread from the center of the world to all being on earth.</p>
  <p style="color:orange"align="center">We bring you the salvation, which is God's message which is the narrow way gospel. <br>We do not speak our words but what God speaks through us as it is written in John 12:49-50 (ESV): "For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment—what to say and what to speak... What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has told me",John 8:28 (NIV): "I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me,John 14:10 (NIV): "The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work"., and John 7:16 (NIV): "My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me".

  <h2><strong><center>What is this salvation we speak about?</center></strong></h2>
  <p><center>The salvation we talk about is the true word of God we speak, as we recently said,<mark style="color:white">"what we speak isn't our own doctrine but God's"</mark>.</center></p>
  <p style="font-family:courier;"align="center"><i><b>Let us look at this short teaching</b></i></p>
  <h3 style="color:Green"align="center">YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF GOD</h3>
  <p align="center">Let us look at 1 Corinthians 3:16-17, it says<i><b>"1 Corinthians 3:16-17 NIV
[16] Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst? [17] If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person; for God’s temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.
  </i></b></p>
  <p align="center">So, the question here is, what destroys the temple of God here?<br>Ahh abi we eat, is it what goes into our body? No! it's the acts of the flesh which are;<br>sexual immorality, hatred, enviness and many more. let us refer to Galatians 5:19-21, and it says<i><b>Galatians 5:19-21 NIV
[19] The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; [20] idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions [21] and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.
</i></b>We now know our body is the temple of God meaning we dont own ourselves also if it's the temple of God it must be sacred, free of sin and impurities.<br> Thanks to the holy spirit he showed us things that destroys the temple of God which are the acts of flesh and listen, he said what? those who live this life style wont inherit the kingdom of God as said in the holy scriptures'</p>
  <p align="center">Do you know all this things that destroys our body is from the world. let us read what being the friend of the world means to God.<i><b>James 4:4 NIV
[4] You adulterous people, don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.</b></i>
Brethren, lets all think of this, can you afford to be God's enemy, The creator's enemy? No so lets all live our life as God's children so we may inherit the kingdom of God as it is writen<b> Blessed are the poor in spirit,fo theirs is the kingdom of heaven</b></b></i></p>
<p align="center"><strong>AMEN</strong></p>
